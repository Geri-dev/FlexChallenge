## How we can make this app more secure?

To ensure the security of our application, it is important to implement measures both on the backend and frontend. For the backend, if the app interacts with an API or database, authentication and authorization should be enforced using JWT or session tokens, along with role-based access control to differentiate privileges such as admin versus viewer. All API requests should use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. API keys and sensitive URLs must be kept in .env files and never included in the source code to prevent accidental exposure.
